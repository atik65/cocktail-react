        <h2>Something About Cocktail</h2>
        <p>
          The Oxford Dictionaries define cocktail as "An alcoholic drink
          consisting of a spirit or spirits mixed with other ingredients, such
          as fruit juice or cream". A cocktail can contain alcohol, a sugar, and
          a bitter/citrus. ... Mixed drinks without alcohol that resemble
          cocktails are known as "mocktails" or "virgin cocktails".
